# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GenAI Service: A Quick Overview

Unlock the power of generative AI models equipped with advanced language comprehension for building the next generation of enterprise applications. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Generative AI is a fully managed service available via API to seamlessly integrate these versatile language models into a wide range of use cases, including writing assistance, summarization, and chat.

Generative AI currently has the following capabilities and model support:

- Text summarization: summarize articles, transcripts, doctorâ€™s notes, internal documents, and more.
- Copy generation: Draft marketing copy, emails, blog posts, product descriptions, and more.
- Chat: Create chatbots that can brainstorm, problem solve, and answer questions. Integrate them with search systems to create a knowledge-grounded information retrieval system.
- Stylistic conversion: Rewrite content in a different style or language.
- Text classification: Classify intent in customer chat logs, support tickets, and more.
- Search: Search call transcripts, internal knowledge sources, and other large corpuses of data to answer questions from users.
- Text Embeddings: embedding your own data to support and increase the knowledge of a model, through insertions and retrievals of this embedded, hyper-compressed data points. A typical use is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generations).

We support finetuning your own base models with custom data as well.

Interaction is allowed through the following ways:

- Using an OCI SDK: this is the way we operate in this use case: using OCI's Python SDK. It allows seamless interaction with your favorite programming language, without needing to create your own custom implementation / framework.
- Using the OCI Console: easy-to-use, browser-based interface, by accessing your OCI account and using the services with the web interface provided by Oracle.
